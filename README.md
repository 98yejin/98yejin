As a developer, I prioritize the developer experience (DX) above all else. To me, technology is simply a tool â€“ my ultimate goal is to enhance the productivity and efficiency of my colleagues. I am a fast learner and am open to utilizing any tools necessary to achieve this objective.

I have diverse experience across various domains, including CI/CD, monitoring, and full-stack development. I am well-versed in iteratively improving and maintaining development tools based on continuous user feedback.

### ESTsecurity, DevOps Engineer

- 07/2020 ~ 02/2021
- PMS-MPI Cell `(Internship)`
- Python Crawler Optimization:
  - Optimized a Python crawler that initially relied entirely on Selenium, resulting in slow performance and frequent failures (over 50% error rate) without any error handling or notifications
  - Refactored parts of the crawler using Scrapy to improve speed and implemented an alerting system
  - Enhanced data collection methods and timing by incorporating server maintenance information and server-provided data
  - Reduced collection time by over 80%, from 3 hours to under 30 minutes
- Automation of Manual Data Entry:
  - Automated the manual entry of version information files, which was a repetitive task prone to errors due to its high volume
  - Decreased the time required for this task from over an hour to less than 10 minutes, significantly improving efficiency and requiring only a final review
- News Crawler and Report Generation:
  - Managed a news crawler that collected 100-200 news articles daily
  - Automated the process of filtering news related to the team's products by:
    - Collecting frequently used keywords from the titles of previously accumulated product-related news (updated periodically using a script)
    - Generating reports based on these keywords, eliminating the need for manual separation of relevant news

## EDUCATION

- Hanyang University(ERICA), Bachelor of Science in Software `(03/2017 ~ 08/2021)`
